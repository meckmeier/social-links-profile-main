## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This project really benefited from EMMET! After putting in the html elements in my index.html, I started to build out the css file and emmet pretty much gave me the bulk of the code i needed. I do wonder how that works? But regardless, it went pretty fast.
HOWEVER, I was tripped up again on getting the main container centered on the page. 


### Continued development

I love the practice. I think I will continue to find websites to build out. Also I think I will take some of the things I learned here and build out my own website, so I can start to USE some of this stuff more specifically for myself.
